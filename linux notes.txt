Froxlor

The Froxlor is a lightweight server management control panel which is developed by experienced Server Administrators to 
simplify the effort of managing your hosting platform. This open source software offers multi-user account feature 
including reseller accounts which can manage reseller resources and limit what the customers may use in the dedicated 
customer panel. You can also manage domain names, FTP accounts, email accounts, support tickets and customers that are 
associated with them. Please note that Froxlor does not come with preinstalled LEMP or LAMP stack. So you need to install the 
LAMP or LEMP stack on your server before proceeding with Froxlor installation.
