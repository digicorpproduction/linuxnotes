Azure Data Studio connections

to connect ADS to SQL database you need:
ip of server
SQL sever communication port if not default 1433
verify SQL is enabled on the server
username and password credentials 

windows authentication uses credentials from the OS
windows to windows connection is easier

more challenging if its linux, docker or mac OS
required kereberos to be enabled 

easiest is set up SQL on linux on docker 
ip address, port, and credentials 

could create a cloud based Azure SQL database
connection details:

run SQL server on docker 
open cmd on OS with docker desktop already installed 

docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'MSQL_SA_PASSWORD=COMPLEXPASSWORD' -p 1401:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest //here we assign ports, we send through port 1401, docker turns around and returns on port 1433, this port forward setup | listening ports should always be 1433
//you can run it on the same ports, 1433:1433, however by assigning two different ports I can run mulitple docker SQL instances

-latest gives us the most recent version with all bug fixes and security patches 
 
you can run the code below to show info on the container

docker ps
 

you can run the code below to show all containers and ids

docker ps -a  //simple troubleshoot is to run this command if you do not see a docker in the above command to ensure all container show

commands to start and stop sql server 

docker start sql server 

docker stop sql server 

for mac or linux,
ipconfig getifaddr en0  //wired connections info about ip and port

ipconfig getifaddr en1 //wireless connections info about ip and port
